## Jan - 1

Abdullah came to my home and we remember a lot of stories that we created.  In the middle of the night, Yasir joined us via a video call. And then I read some articles about 8086 microprocessors. I give AI exam, and my preparation was not good but I can perform well. There is a big chance to miss A+

## Jan - 2

Early got up in the morning and started to memorize the EMU 8086 pin number and details. The day after today, I have a microprocessor final exam. After completing the content I realize this is not for all. Totally time-consuming. 

## Jan - 3

I give a microprocessor exam. Alhamdullilah Better than AI exam. The course teacher is AFZ( Shoukhin).  She lost her phone in Zindabazar. I warned her that we did not go there, but she did not care about my advice. When the accident occur and we noticed, she has broken. We have planned to go to Medical but we can not go there for this unexpected accident. 

## Jan - 4

Reading CN topics and practicing some math about IP. I love to calculate IP address math and subnetting. 

## Jan - 5

I gave 6 hours exam for 2 subjects .! Between these 2 exams I got 60-minute break for moving from one place to another place. I performed well.  In the evening, we team Lu\_deadlock wrote documentation for the upcoming Hackathon (SUST). The selection depends on the documentation. Let's see what happens. 

## Jan - 6

I got up in the morning at 9:30 am, and then I went to LU. Where I went for self-studying. I watch a video on YouTube about Time and Space complexity. It was recorded by Striver. Before watching this video I have a little doubt about TC. Big O is the way of representing the complexity of any code. There is also theta and average, but these are not used regularly. I also wrote a doc about TC. At the beginning of the afternoon, we were back in the city from LU. Firstly we go to Kabab kharigor and then go to another new cafe ( cafe argo)  for eating Pizza. They offered 50% off for the new year.

## Jan - 7 :

Passing day at home and Installing and setting up flutter and also creating a basic app. Also outside the home with her and shopping for a sneaker.
