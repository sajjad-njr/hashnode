### Jan - 8

I got up late in the morning and then brushed my teeth. After that, I went back home. Now we are on the bus. Sometimes listening to podcasts, sometimes reading tweets.Â  Meeting with my mom after so long and then discussed various topics. She cooked deer meat and also other items. In the evening, I went back to my grandfather's home and discussed it with him.Â 

`Learning:` No learning that day.Â 

### Jan - 9

We drink a cup of tea together and then watch a movie. After that, I had a long discussion about my Grandfather and how he passed his life in Pakistan, Kuwait, and neighboring countries. He described the entire story of his journey.Â At lunchtime, we went back to Sylhet by CNG. We faced a terrible accident after a 50 km ride. The car was UNO but after the accident, they acted as if they had made no mistake. And then at night, I develop a basic calculator with the help of a YouTube tutorial. I learned how MediaQuery divides the screen.Â Also, I have trouble with git merge. I changed the repository name on GitHub but didnâ€™t update it locally. Whenever I push, it shows a link where I merge.Â 

`Learning:` MediaQuery in a flutter, recap widgets of flutter.Â 

### Jan - 10

I got up at 8:00 clock. It's too late but I couldnâ€™t recover. After that, I fix my git problem, and then I plan to make a simple app where we traverse page to page with the help of the page routes abstract Method. I started it earlier but I couldnâ€™t finish the line due to Load-shedding. IÂ  am stuck ðŸ˜¢

I went to my sister's home to meet my two lovely twin nephews.Â In the evening I am looking for the difference between REST `API` and `GRAPHQL`. How it works: I have little experience with the REST API, so I am focused on [GRAPHQL](https://graphql.org/).Â  I created an account here, which I didn't understand yet.Â 

`Learning:` Articles read about GraphQl and Rest API. Build a mini project.Â 

### Jan - 11

I read a few topics about the KKN algorithm from ML.Â Finally,Â  I created an account on Graphql and it connected with Neon Database. I also made a table and then inserted two rows there manually.Â I am going to date her after one week. We share a lot of stories, and also discuss how to utilize time in 2023. And then I joined another party where they are planning to go somewhere, unfortunately, we lost a friend's father. As a result, the plan vanished.Â I have also received an acceptance letter from the SUST hackathon. We have a team meeting at 10:30 pm, but due to several issues itâ€™s postponed announced by Lu\_deadlockÂ 

`learning:` create an account on Graphql and Invert some rows.Â 

### Jan - 12

I and Talha designed UI/UX for my first android project (CSE-3300). It took approximately seven hours to complete it. He has a very good sense of design. It was 6:00, and we were still discussing buying a host to make our server.Â I slept the whole day. During sleep time I woke once to take my lunch and bath. Though I had a headache, I couldnâ€™t do any work. I just watched a basic tutorial about Python in Jupiter.Â I learned an interesting thing which is passing arguments on print(). Generally, the separation is used for `" "` an **end,** And the new line `"\n"`. We can customize it.Â

I went to bed early because the day after I planned a tour with my Rockers.

`learning:` basic Python, complete UI/Ux for project -1

### Jan - 13

A special day for me ( we rockers). This is the official tour day with my beloved mates. I woke up very early in the morning and perform Fazar salah, and then I changed my dress. It is a very foggy morning, nothing is visual.Â Â 

One after one we enter the car from different places. It took two and a half hours to reach the destination. Our first spot is " **Dibir haor** " which is situated in the northern part of Sylhet, Bangladesh. It is also called " Shapla Bill", ( waterlily swamp)Â . The arrangement of that place was not well. Another place is Lalakhal nearest the first spot. The day was full of enjoyment. When I returned home I was not able to do other work.Â 

### Jan - 14

Earlier this morning I attended one of my friend's marriage. I met with some familiar people and discussed several topics. At the moment of the discussion, one of my uncles said, " Your Partner is important whatever you do.

Today I started to learn asp dot net core MVC. Here firstly I see about the version control. None other than git and GitHub come first.

This week I spent most of the time on outings, with no dramatic improvement. I am trying to cover it.

Thank YOU.
